In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses a case of a 10-month-old boy who was brought in by his mother for a cold that had been ongoing for two weeks. The child presented with low-grade fevers, was clingy, had diarrhea, and was not particularly hungry or thirsty. Bridge prescribed DPT 30 and Pulsatilla 200 based on the child's symptoms and recent vaccination history. The child improved but later developed a swollen, painful left testicle. The mother asked if there was a connection between the remedies and the new symptom. Bridge confirmed a link to Pulsatilla and shared this information with the mother. The hospital decided to wait on surgery based on the homeopathic perspective that it was likely an inflammatory response rather than torsion. Later, the father revealed a family history of left testicle issues, providing insight into the case. Bridge discusses the importance of honesty, understanding the patient's reaction to remedies, and the phenomenon of dormant symptoms surfacing during treatment.
