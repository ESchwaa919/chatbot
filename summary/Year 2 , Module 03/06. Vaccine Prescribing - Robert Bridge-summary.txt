In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses vaccine prescribing from a homeopathic perspective. He covers topics such as the current vaccine schedule, historical changes in the schedule, prescribing remedies before and after vaccinations, alternatives to vaccinations, and addressing vaccine reactions. Bridge emphasizes the importance of separating the debate about vaccinations from homeopathy and encourages parents to make decisions based on a positive outlook rather than fear of negative outcomes. He also discusses the use of homeopathic remedies such as Arnica, Hypericum, Ledum, Stramonium, and Opium to address specific aspects of vaccine reactions. Additionally, he touches on the concept of homeoprophylaxis as an alternative to conventional vaccinations and the use of constitutional and miasmatic remedies to support a child's overall health.

<topics>
1. Current vaccine schedule and historical changes: Bridge discusses the current UK vaccine schedule, which includes a six-in-one immunization, along with additional vaccines for pneumococcal, meningococcal, and rotavirus. He also highlights the significant increase in the number of vaccine components compared to previous decades.

2. Prescribing remedies before and after vaccinations: Bridge suggests using remedies such as Arnica, Hypericum, and Ledum before and after vaccinations to address potential physical trauma, needle injury, and toxic effects on the bloodstream. He also discusses the use of Stramonium and Opium for emotional reactions.

3. Alternatives to vaccinations: Bridge explores the concept of homeoprophylaxis, which involves using homeopathic remedies made from disease materials instead of vaccines. He expresses mixed feelings about this approach and emphasizes the importance of supporting a child's overall health through constitutional and miasmatic remedies.

4. Addressing vaccine reactions: Bridge discusses the use of vaccine remedies in potency to address specific reactions, as well as the importance of looking up information about the vaccine components and common symptom pictures. He also mentions the cease protocol developed by Tinus Smits and Tanya Hansen, which involves using intercurrent remedies to address toxicity and miasmatic susceptibilities.
