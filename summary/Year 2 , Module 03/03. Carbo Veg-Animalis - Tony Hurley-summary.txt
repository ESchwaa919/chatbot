<summary>
This lecture by Tony Hurley discusses the homeopathic remedies carbo vegetabilis (carbo veg) and carbo animalis, which are made from vegetable and animal charcoal respectively. Carbo veg is described as a remedy for states of under-oxygenation, exhaustion, collapse, flatulence, and poor vitality. It is called the "corpse reviver" remedy. Carbo animalis is a more toxic, cancerous remedy associated with senility, rigidity, and degeneration. The lecture covers the mental/emotional and physical indications, clinical uses, and keynotes of these remedies. It also compares them to other carbon-based and complementary remedies.
