In this lecture, Carol Boyce discusses the current state of homeopathy and the challenges it faces from skeptics and denialists. She argues that despite the opposition, there has never been a better time to be a homeopath due to the paradigm shift in medicine towards individualized treatment, epigenetics, and the microbiome. Boyce provides a detailed account of the anti-homeopathy campaign over the past two decades, including the Shang meta-analysis, the UK parliamentary Science and Technology Committee investigation, and the efforts of various individuals and organizations such as Sense About Science, the Good Thinking Society, and Edzard Ernst. She also highlights the growing criticism of conventional medicine from within the scientific community and the increasing recognition of the limitations and dangers of pharmaceutical drugs. Boyce encourages homeopaths to stand firm in their beliefs, to be well-trained and compassionate, and to continue to promote the benefits of homeopathy despite the opposition.
