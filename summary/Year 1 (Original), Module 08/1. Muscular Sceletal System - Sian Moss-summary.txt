The lecture titled "1. Muscular Skeletal System - Sian Moss" provides a detailed overview of the muscular skeletal system. The lecture covers the key components of the system including bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, blood, and nerves. The lecture discusses the functions of the skeleton such as support, mineral storage, blood cell production, protection, and facilitation of movement. The lecture also covers the structure of the spinal column, the anatomy of a typical long bone, and the importance of exercise for bone health. The lecture then delves into the role of hormones such as growth hormone, thyroxin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen in bone growth and calcium homeostasis. The lecture emphasizes the importance of maintaining healthy blood calcium levels for various bodily functions and the mechanisms by which the body regulates these levels.

1. Components of the muscular skeletal system: The lecture covers the key components of the muscular skeletal system including bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, blood, and nerves. The lecturer provides context on how these components work together to form the muscular skeletal system.

2. Functions of the skeleton: The lecture discusses the main functions of the skeleton such as support, mineral storage, blood cell production, protection, and facilitation of movement. The lecturer provides examples of how the skeleton performs these functions.

3. Structure of the spinal column: The lecture covers the structure of the spinal column, including the different regions of the spine such as the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccyx. The lecturer also discusses the importance of the spinal cord and nerve roots.

4. Anatomy of a typical long bone: The lecture covers the anatomy of a typical long bone, including the different parts such as the epiphysis, diaphysis, periosteum, and medullary cavity. The lecturer also discusses the importance of bone marrow and blood supply to the bone.

5. Hormonal regulation of bone growth and calcium homeostasis: The lecture delves into the role of hormones such as growth hormone, thyroxin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen in bone growth and calcium homeostasis. The lecturer provides context on how these hormones work together to maintain healthy blood calcium levels.
