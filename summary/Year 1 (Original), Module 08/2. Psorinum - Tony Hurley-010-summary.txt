In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses the homeopathic remedy Psorinum, which is made from the pathological matter of a scabies vesicle. He explains that the Psorinum state is often associated with deep privation, poverty, and a lack of hygiene. The remedy is indicated for individuals with skin eruptions, bowel issues, and a sense of impoverishment. Hurley also discusses the relationship between Psorinum and the psoric miasm, which is considered the mother of all other miasms. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's susceptibility and predisposition to disease, as well as the role of suppression in the development of chronic conditions. Hurley also touches on the use of Psorinum in cases where well-indicated remedies have failed to work, and discusses the challenges of treating patients who are on allopathic medications.

1. Psorinum remedy: Psorinum is a homeopathic remedy made from the pathological matter of a scabies vesicle. It is often indicated for individuals with skin eruptions, bowel issues, and a sense of impoverishment.

2. Psoric miasm: The psoric miasm is considered the mother of all other miasms and is associated with a state of deep privation, poverty, and a lack of hygiene. Psorinum is a key remedy in addressing the psoric miasm.

3. Susceptibility and predisposition: Understanding a patient's susceptibility and predisposition to disease is crucial in selecting the appropriate homeopathic remedy. Psorinum is often indicated for individuals with a history of suppressed skin eruptions and a tendency towards chronic conditions.

4. Suppression and chronic disease: Suppression of skin eruptions and other symptoms can lead to the development of chronic conditions. Psorinum is often used in cases where well-indicated remedies have failed to work due to the presence of a deeper, underlying pathology.

5. Challenges in homeopathic treatment: Treating patients who are on allopathic medications can be challenging, as these medications can interfere with the action of homeopathic remedies. Homeopaths must navigate these challenges and make philosophical decisions about how to approach treatment in such cases.
