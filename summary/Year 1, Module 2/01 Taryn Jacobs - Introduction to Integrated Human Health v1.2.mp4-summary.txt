In this lecture, Taryn Jacobs introduces a new course called Integrated Human Health, which is a revamped version of the traditional Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) course. She emphasizes that the course will focus on energizing the topic and exploring the ways in which the body communicates and acts as a biofeedback machine, rather than viewing it as a machine that can break. Taryn also discusses the effects of chronic stress and trauma on the body, the concept of entrainment between bodies, and the intelligence present in every cell of the body. She encourages students to approach the body with gentleness, compassion, and a sense of its inherent divinity, even in the face of illness or disease.

<topics>
1. Integrated Human Health course: Taryn introduces a new approach to teaching A&P that focuses on the body's intelligence and communication, rather than just its structure and function.

2. Effects of chronic stress and trauma: Taryn discusses how chronic stress and trauma, even without a capital "T," can have real effects on the body and should be considered when approaching patients with gentleness and compassion.

3. Entrainment between bodies: Taryn explains the concept of entrainment, where bodies in close proximity can influence each other's physiological rhythms, such as menstrual cycles, breathing patterns, and brain wavelengths.

4. Intelligence in every cell: Taryn emphasizes the intelligence present in every cell of the body, likening it to a divine dance that continues even in the face of illness or disease.

<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the idea that bodies in close proximity can entrain to one another, influencing each other's physiological rhythms without conscious awareness. This highlights the interconnectedness of human bodies and the profound effects we can have on one another simply by being in close proximity.
