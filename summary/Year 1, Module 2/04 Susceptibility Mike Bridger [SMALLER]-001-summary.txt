In this lecture, Mike Bridger discusses the concept of susceptibility in homeopathy. He explains that susceptibility is the weakness or predisposition of an individual that makes them more likely to develop certain illnesses or conditions. Homeopathy focuses on treating the individual's reaction to the illness rather than just the cause. Bridger emphasizes the importance of individualizing treatment based on the patient's specific symptoms and reactions. He also discusses the role of miasms, or inherited dispositions, in susceptibility and how homeopathy can help to address these underlying weaknesses. Bridger provides examples of how different individuals may react differently to the same stressor or illness, and how homeopathy can help to unblock and balance these reactions. He also touches on the importance of the practitioner-patient relationship in homeopathy and how the practitioner's understanding of homeopathic principles allows them to effectively support their patients.
