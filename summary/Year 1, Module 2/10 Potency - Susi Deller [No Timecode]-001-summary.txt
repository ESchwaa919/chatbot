In this lecture, Susi Deller provides an introduction to potency in homeopathy. She begins by defining potency as the power, strength, and potential of a remedy. She then explains the different scales of potency, including X, C, and M, and how they are diluted. Deller emphasizes that the more dilute the substance, the more powerful it is. She then describes the qualities of different potencies, with 200C being the most energetic and unstable, while lower potencies like X and C are more material and used for chronic physical conditions and first aid. Higher potencies like 1M and 10M are used for deeper, more mental and emotional issues. Deller stresses the importance of matching the potency to the energy of the patient's state and the intention of the prescription. She also discusses how different homeopathic methods have their own prescribing strategies for potency and repetition of dose.
