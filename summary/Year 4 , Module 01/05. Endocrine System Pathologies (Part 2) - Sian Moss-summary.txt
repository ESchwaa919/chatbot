In this lecture, Sian Moss discusses the differences between stress and burnout syndrome, emphasizing that they are not the same thing. She explains the biological mechanisms behind stress responses, including the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and cortisol. Burnout syndrome is defined as a result of chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy. Moss argues that the term "adrenal fatigue" is misleading and that hypercortisolism is controlled by the brain rather than the adrenals. She also touches on the concept of resilience and how individuals respond differently to stressors, using the examples of Batman and the Joker. Moss provides some homeopathic remedies for stress and emphasizes the importance of self-realization and empowering patients to heal themselves.
