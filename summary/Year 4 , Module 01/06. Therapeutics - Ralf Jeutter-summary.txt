In this lecture, Ralf Jeutter discusses the concept of therapeutics in homeopathy. He explains that therapeutics involves prescribing remedies based on the diagnostic label of the disease, rather than solely on the individualized symptoms of the patient. Jeutter emphasizes the importance of considering the anatomical affinity of the remedy to the affected organ or system, in addition to individualizing the remedy based on the patient's unique symptoms. He also discusses the various categories of diseases, including one-sided diseases, local diseases, fixed or acute miasmatic diseases, and epidemic diseases, and how therapeutics can be applied in each case. Jeutter stresses the importance of taking a complete case and considering the totality of symptoms, even when using a therapeutic approach. He also highlights the significance of studying the Organon and Materia Medica to develop a deep understanding of homeopathic principles and remedies.
