This lecture by Dion Tabrett discusses the curability of tumors from a homeopathic perspective. Tabrett defines a tumor as any swelling, including warts, cysts, fibroids, adenomas, and cancers. He emphasizes that homeopathy has been treating tumors successfully for hundreds of years. Tabrett provides historical context by referencing prominent homeopaths such as Grimmer, Clark, Cooper, and Burnett, who have written about their experiences treating tumors. He then presents several case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in treating various types of tumors, including breast cancer in a dog, warts on the hands and arms, and molluscum contagiosum. Tabrett also discusses the importance of considering a patient's infectious disease history when selecting a remedy, as demonstrated in a case of a benign testicular cyst that was successfully treated with a nosode based on the patient's history of mumps.
