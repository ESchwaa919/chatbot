The lecture titled "10. Ellis Barker - Dion Tabrett" discusses the life and work of Ellis Barker, a Jewish German immigrant who became a homeopath in Britain in the early 20th century. Barker was a close friend of John Henry Clark, a prominent homeopath who was also a member of a racist organization. Barker's approach to homeopathy involved polypharmacy, which is the use of multiple remedies at the same time, as opposed to the classical approach of using a single remedy. Barker's method involved prescribing remedies for different aspects of the patient's condition, including lesions, fundamental and constitutional issues, and miasms. He also emphasized the importance of dietary adjustments, exercise, and giving hope to the patient. The lecture also discusses a case study of a 29-year-old woman with kidney cysts and stones, and how Barker's approach was used to treat her condition.
