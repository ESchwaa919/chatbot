In this lecture, Suzi Deller provides a comprehensive review of potency in homeopathy. She begins by discussing the available literature on potency, including books by Michelle Shine and Marguerite Proveer. Deller then answers questions from students regarding the differences between various forms of remedies (powders, pills, tablets) and potency scales used in different parts of the world. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the intention behind prescribing a particular potency and how it relates to the similarity of the remedy to the patient's condition. Deller uses several examples to illustrate how to choose the appropriate potency based on the totality of symptoms, the intensity of the condition, and the level of vitality of the patient. She also discusses the concept of increasing potency as the patient's vibration rises during treatment. Throughout the lecture, Deller stresses the importance of responding to the signs given by the vital force rather than trying to intellectually decide what the patient needs. She concludes by explaining how the method or approach being used (classical, organ therapy, lesion layer, etc.) serves as a starting point for choosing potency and repetition of dose.
