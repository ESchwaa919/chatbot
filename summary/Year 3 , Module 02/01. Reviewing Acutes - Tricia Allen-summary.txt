<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the idea of "paper remedies," where the name and potency of the remedy are written on a piece of paper and placed under a glass of water, which the patient then sips. Tricia shares a story of how this method worked for her son when he was unable to drink water after surgery and she didn't have the needed remedy on hand.
