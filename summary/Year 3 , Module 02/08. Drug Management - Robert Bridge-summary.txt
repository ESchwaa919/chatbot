In this lecture, Robert Bridge presents a real-life case of an 18-year-old girl with a history of psychiatric problems, including psychotic episodes, violent behavior, and suicidal tendencies. The girl had been hospitalized for two years and was on a cocktail of medications. After being discharged, she was brought to see a homeopath by her parents. Bridge discusses the challenges of taking on such a case, including the lack of direct communication with the patient, the urgency of the situation, and the need to prove oneself as a homeopath. He also reflects on the importance of considering the safety of the patient and the prescriber, the need for support from other professionals, and the potential pitfalls of trying to prove the effectiveness of homeopathy in such a complex case.

<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the prescriber's admission that his decision to prescribe a combination of remedies was driven by a sense of desperation and a need to prove himself, rather than a clear understanding of the patient's needs and the appropriate course of action.
