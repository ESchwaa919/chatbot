<summary>
In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian discusses three homeopathic remedies - Medorrhinum, Tarantula, and Belladonna - in the context of treating children with delayed development and behavioral issues such as ADHD. She describes the key characteristics of each remedy, including physical symptoms, emotional and behavioral traits, and fears. Medorrhinum is associated with spaciness, mucus, nail-biting, and a desire for fruit and orange juice. Tarantula is characterized by high energy, a love of rhythm and dance, a desire for freedom and attention, and threatening behavior. Belladonna is associated with sudden mood changes, violent behavior, an interest in war play, and a fear of the dark and monsters. Dorrian also discusses the importance of cross-crawling for brain development and the potential for dyslexia and dyspraxia in children who skip this stage.
