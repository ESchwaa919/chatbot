1. Kali phosphoricum (K phos): This salt is associated with nervous exhaustion, brain fog, and mental fatigue due to overwork or over-study. It is useful for supporting the nervous system and addressing chronic fatigue states.

2. Magnesium phosphoricum (Mag phos): This salt is the primary remedy for cramping, including abdominal cramps, menstrual cramps, and any form of muscular cramping. It is also helpful during labor and for writer's cramp or trigeminal neuralgia.

3. Natrum muriaticum (Nat mur): This salt is used for fluid balance in the body, addressing either excess dryness or watery discharge. It is useful for conditions such as runny colds, hay fever, and constipation.

4. Silicea: This salt focuses on strengthening the body's connective tissue, particularly the spine. It is useful for building spinal health, bone strength, and neurological strength in general. Silicea is also helpful for fungal infections and cleansing the body.

5. Relationship between tissue salts and astrological signs: Hurley briefly explores the potential connections between the 12 tissue salts and the 12 astrological signs, suggesting that some signs may have a stronger affinity for certain salts. However, he acknowledges that this concept is controversial and not universally accepted.

The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the potential connection between tissue salts and astrological signs. Hurley suggests that each astrological sign may have a corresponding tissue salt that relates to its characteristics and the body parts it is associated with. While he acknowledges that this idea is controversial and not a perfect fit for all signs, it offers an interesting perspective on the relationship between homeopathy and astrology.
