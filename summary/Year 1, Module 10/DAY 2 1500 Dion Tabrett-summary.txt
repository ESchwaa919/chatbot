This lecture focuses on Classical Homeopathy, case analysis, and prescribing strategies. The instructor begins with an overview of the different approaches to homeopathy, including Classical, layers (Eizayaga), and Burnett's methods. The instructor then reviews the key principles of Classical Homeopathy, including the hierarchy of symptoms (mental/emotional, physical general, and physical particular), potency selection, and the use of miasms. The instructor emphasizes the importance of taking a thorough case history, identifying the relevant symptoms, and matching them to the appropriate rubrics in the repertory. The instructor then presents a case of an 11-year-old girl with asthma and eczema, demonstrating how to analyze the case using the Classical approach. The instructor highlights the key symptoms and rubrics used to arrive at the prescription of Natrum muriaticum, which leads to significant improvement in the patient's condition over time. The lecture concludes with a discussion of the patient's progress and the eventual emergence of Phosphorus as the underlying constitutional remedy.
