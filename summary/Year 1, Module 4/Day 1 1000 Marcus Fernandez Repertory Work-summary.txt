In this lecture, Marcus Fernandez discusses the process of repertorization in homeopathy. He explains how to use a repertory, which is a book that lists symptoms and the remedies associated with them. The students are given a case of a 7-year-old boy with nosebleeds and are asked to find rubrics (symptoms) in the repertory that match the case. They then score the remedies listed under each rubric and total the scores to determine the most likely remedy for the case. Fernandez emphasizes the importance of being as specific as possible when selecting rubrics and reminds the students that learning to use the repertory takes time and practice.
