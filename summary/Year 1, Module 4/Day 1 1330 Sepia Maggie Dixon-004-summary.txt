The lecturer explains the significance of Sepia in treating feminine health issues, particularly those related to hormonal imbalances, suppression, stagnation, and loss of connection. The remedy's source, the cuttlefish, is described as an evolved, speedy, and active creature that uses its ink as a defense mechanism.
