This lecture by Robert Bridge discusses a homeopathic case of a three-year-old boy with behavioral issues, delayed speech development, and recurrent colds and acute infections. The child is sensitive to loud noises, particularly sneezing, and becomes hysterical when startled. He is territorial, has a restricted diet, and obsesses over past upsetting events. The child's birth was fast and traumatic, and he was born with a sixth toe. The lecturer guides the audience through the process of analyzing the case and selecting an appropriate homeopathic remedy, ultimately choosing Borax due to the child's extreme sensitivity to noise and the remedy's unique symptom profile. The child responded well to the remedy, with reduced noise sensitivity and accelerated speech development, calling into question the potential autism diagnosis.
