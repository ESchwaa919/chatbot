In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian discusses the topic of delayed development in children and how homeopathic remedies can help. She focuses on two specific remedies: Baryta carb and Bufo rana. Baryta carb is useful for children who are shy, slow to develop, dependent on others, and have difficulty with new situations or responsibilities. Bufo rana is helpful for children with even lower abilities, often with speech delays, oral fixations, and a tendency to be overweight due to lack of muscle tone. Hilery emphasizes that these remedies can significantly improve the quality of life and potential of children with developmental delays, including those with Down syndrome or autism spectrum disorders. She also discusses the challenges of implementing homeopathic treatment in institutional settings and shares personal anecdotes to illustrate the characteristics of these remedies.
