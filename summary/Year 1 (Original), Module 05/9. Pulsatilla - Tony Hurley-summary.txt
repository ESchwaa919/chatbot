In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses the homeopathic remedy Pulsatilla in detail. He covers the key characteristics of the Pulsatilla personality, which include being gentle, yielding, changeable, and emotionally dependent. Pulsatilla individuals have a strong need for security and can be easily taken advantage of. They are prone to weepiness and cry easily. Physically, Pulsatilla is indicated for mucousy, yellow-green catarrhal discharges, menstrual irregularities, and symptoms that change or move around the body. It is a key remedy for hormonal transitions like puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Pulsatilla individuals crave open air, dislike rich fatty food, and are thirstless.
