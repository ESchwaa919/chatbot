<topics>
1. Germ theory of disease: The lecture discusses the germ theory of disease, which suggests that specific germs cause specific diseases, and the competing theory that the internal environment of the body plays a larger role in disease. 
2. History of vaccinations: The lecture covers the development of vaccinations, starting with Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine and the push for compulsory vaccination in the 19th century.
3. Decline of infectious diseases: The lecture presents data showing that infectious diseases were declining before the introduction of vaccines, likely due to improved living conditions and sanitation.
4. Risks and side effects of vaccines: The lecture discusses the potential risks and side effects of vaccines, including ingredients such as mercury and aluminum, and conditions such as Shaken Baby Syndrome and SIDS.
5. Vaccine uptake and suppression of concerns: The lecture covers the push for vaccine uptake and the suppression of vaccine concerns in the medical community, including the labeling of vaccine-hesitant individuals and the potential consequences for medical professionals who express concerns about vaccines.
