This lecture by Ralf Jeutter focuses on the life and work of Constantine Hering, a key figure in the history of homeopathy. Hering was a prolific prover of remedies, conducting 104 provings himself. He introduced the use of higher potencies, going beyond the 200C that Hahnemann used. Hering also developed the Guiding Symptoms of the Materia Medica, a comprehensive collection of clinically verified symptoms. He taught African Caribbean students in his home when they were barred from medical schools. Hering's Law of Cure, which states that symptoms move from more vital to less vital organs, from the inside out, and in reverse order of their appearance, was originally called a law by Hering but later regarded as more of a rule. Hering expanded the homeopathic materia medica in several ways, including the use of poisons, nosodes, sarcodes, auto-nosodes, and the introduction of homeo-prophylaxis.
