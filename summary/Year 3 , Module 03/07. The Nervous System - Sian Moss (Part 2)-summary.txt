The lecture "07. The Nervous System - Sian Moss (Part 2)" covers the transmission of nerve impulses along the axon, the function of synapses in signal transmission, the structure and function of the central nervous system, and the complexity of the brain. The lecture explains the role of electrical potentials, ion movements, and neurotransmitters in the transmission of signals across the synapse. It also describes the structure of the brain, including the hemispheres, lobes, and internal structures such as the hippocampus and basal ganglia. The lecture emphasizes the importance of the cerebellum in spatial awareness and the vagus nerve in controlling vital functions. Finally, the lecture highlights the current limitations in understanding the brain's wiring and the need for further research to map the brain at the level of individual synaptic vesicles.
