The patient is a 42-year-old woman with various physical and emotional symptoms, including back pain, neck pain, digestive issues, and anxiety. Mike guides the class through the process of identifying key symptoms, finding appropriate rubrics, and selecting potential remedies. The class considers several remedies, including Calc carb, Lycopodium, Silica, and Arsenicum.

He also discusses the relationship between certain remedies and the concept of miasms, particularly the tubercular miasm. Ultimately, Mike suggests Calc carb as the most appropriate starting remedy for this patient, with the possibility of moving to other related remedies if needed.
