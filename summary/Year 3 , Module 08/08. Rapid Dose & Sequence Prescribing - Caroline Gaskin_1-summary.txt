<summary>
In this lecture, Caroline Gaskin discusses rapid dose and sequence prescribing techniques in homeopathy. She starts by reviewing potency, explaining the differences between centesimal, decimal, and LM potencies. Gaskin then explains rapid dose technique, where a remedy is given every 15 seconds for 15 minutes, then every 15 minutes for an hour, then hourly for 6 hours. She also discusses rapid ascending dose technique, rotating through 30C, 200C, 1M and 10M potencies. Gaskin presents a case study of a 2-year-old child with behavioral issues, and how she used a sequence prescription of Aconite, Stramonium, Arsenicum, and Phosphorus to address the child's issues stemming from prenatal trauma. She also discusses using ascending and descending potencies to clear miasms and treat chronic conditions.
