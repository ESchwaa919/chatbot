In this lecture, Ralf Jeutter discusses several homeopathic cases from his experience working in Ghana. He presents each case, including the patient's symptoms, and then discusses potential remedies that could be prescribed based on the symptomatology. The cases cover a range of conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, urinary problems, and general pain and discomfort. Throughout the lecture, Jeutter emphasizes the importance of considering key symptoms and modalities when selecting a remedy, as well as the need to differentiate between similar remedies based on the totality of the patient's symptoms. He also highlights the challenges of working in a resource-limited setting, where follow-up can be difficult and cases may be complex or incomplete.
