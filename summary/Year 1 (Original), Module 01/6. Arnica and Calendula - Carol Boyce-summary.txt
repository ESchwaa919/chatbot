Here are my responses to the questions based on the lecture transcript:

<summary>
This lecture by Carol Boyce discusses two homeopathic remedies from the Compositae family - Arnica and Calendula. Arnica is used for trauma, bruising, shock (physical and emotional), and overexertion. It has a chronic picture beyond just first aid usage. Calendula is used for open wounds, promoting healing, and preventing infection and scarring. The lecture provides examples of the usage of these remedies. It also touches on challenges in interfacing with conventional medicine and the importance of the vital force and susceptibility in homeopathy.
