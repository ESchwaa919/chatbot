In this lecture, Mike Bridger discusses the Law of Cure in homeopathy, which describes how symptoms are alleviated as a patient recovers from an illness. He explains that symptoms move from above downwards, from within outwards, from the most important organs to the least important, and in the reverse order of appearance. Bridger emphasizes the importance of observing and treating the individual symptoms of each patient rather than just the disease label. He also discusses how emotional symptoms can shift during treatment and how the remedy can sometimes cause a temporary aggravation of symptoms before improvement occurs. Bridger presents several case studies to illustrate these principles in action.
