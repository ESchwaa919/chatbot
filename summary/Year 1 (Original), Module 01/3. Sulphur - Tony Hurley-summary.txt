In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses the homeopathic remedy Sulphur in great detail. He begins by explaining how Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, discovered that many chronic cases were caused by the suppression of skin eruptions, and that Sulphur was the remedy that addressed this tendency. Hurley then delves into the physical and mental/emotional characteristics of the typical Sulphur person, including their red, hot, burning skin eruptions, their philosophical and egotistical nature, their laziness and slovenliness, and their love of sweets, spicy foods, and alcohol. He also discusses the various manifestations of Sulphur in different individuals, such as the thin, intellectual type and the more robust, practical type. Throughout the lecture, Hurley emphasizes the importance of not stereotyping or caricaturing individuals based on remedy pictures, and of treating each person as a unique individual.
