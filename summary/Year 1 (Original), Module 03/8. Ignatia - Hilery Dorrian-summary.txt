In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian discusses the homeopathic remedy Ignatia in detail. She describes Ignatia as a well-known remedy for grief, but emphasizes that it is not the only remedy for grief and can be useful in both acute and long-term grief situations. Ignatia is characterized by intense, raw emotions that feel like the grief happened yesterday, even if it occurred long ago. It is particularly useful for the loss of a child. Ignatia is also associated with idealism and disappointment, as well as hysterical outbursts and exaggeration. It is a paradoxical remedy, with contradictory and changeable symptoms. Ignatia is useful for teenagers, refugees, and those experiencing homesickness. Physically, Ignatia is associated with spasms, cramps, throat problems, digestive issues, and headaches. It is a significant constitutional remedy that can help with deep pathology, not just acute situations.
