In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses acute prescribing in homeopathy. He begins by emphasizing the importance of prescribing early and taking cases of the sickest people to gain experience. Bridge then outlines key aspects of acute prescribing, such as keeping it simple, observing rather than conversing, and using the CLAMS acronym (Concomitant, Location, Aetiology, Modalities, Sensation). He shares a memorable case of a woman in her 50s with a history of gallstone colic who was in intensive care with multiple organ failure. Despite the complexity and severity of the case, Bridge prescribed Lachesis 30C twice daily, and the patient's condition improved significantly within 24 hours. He later prescribed Arnica 200C to address the patient's respiratory issues and shock, which led to her being taken off the respirator and discharged from intensive care. Throughout the lecture, Bridge emphasizes the importance of trusting the process, even in the face of doubt, and recognizing the patient's inner resources and support system.
