<summary>
In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian discusses various homeopathic remedies for treating menstrual disorders, particularly painful periods (dysmenorrhea) and heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). She covers remedies such as anterior pituitary gland, viburnum (cramp bark), mag phos, calophyllum, zanthoxylum, dioscorea, helonias, sabina, belladonna, ipecac, and phosphorus. Dorrian provides detailed descriptions of the specific symptoms each remedy is suited for, including the nature and location of menstrual pain, emotional symptoms, and concomitant symptoms. She shares several cases from her practice illustrating the successful use of these remedies in women suffering from severe menstrual disorders. Dorrian also touches on the conventional medical approaches to dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia and some of their shortcomings compared to homeopathic treatment.
