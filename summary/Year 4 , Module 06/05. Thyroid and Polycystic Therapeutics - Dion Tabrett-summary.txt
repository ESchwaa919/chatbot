In this lecture, Dion Tabrett discusses the treatment of thyroid disorders and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from a homeopathic perspective. He covers the allopathic treatments for hyperthyroidism, including anti-thyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and surgery, and their limitations. Tabrett then delves into the homeopathic approach, discussing the use of constitutional remedies, miasmatic treatments, and organ-specific remedies. He emphasizes the importance of treating the underlying cause and the whole person, rather than just the symptoms. Tabrett also discusses the role of stress and the sympathetic nervous system in these conditions. He provides specific remedy suggestions for both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, such as Calcarea carbonica, Iodum, and Lachesis. For PCOS, Tabrett discusses the influence of the oral contraceptive pill and suggests remedies such as Apis, Lachesis, Lycopodium, and Thuja. He also mentions the use of sarcodes such as estrogen and testosterone to help balance hormones while addressing the underlying causes.
