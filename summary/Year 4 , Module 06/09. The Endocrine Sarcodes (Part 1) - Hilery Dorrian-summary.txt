In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian discusses the endocrine system and its associated remedies in homeopathy. She shares a story of a patient with severe hypothyroidism who successfully treated her condition with homeopathy instead of conventional medicine. Dorrian explains how this experience led her to treat many thyroid patients and gain a deeper understanding of the endocrine remedies. She emphasizes the importance of the endocrine system as the interface between our physical, emotional, and etheric selves, producing hormones and neurotransmitters that shape our personality and behaviors. Dorrian also discusses how childhood experiences influence the development of neural pathways, which in turn affect our stress responses and coping mechanisms later in life.
