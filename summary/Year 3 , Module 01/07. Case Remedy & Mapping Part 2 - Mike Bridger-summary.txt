In this lecture, Mike Bridger discusses a case of a young boy with recurrent tonsillitis and his treatment journey over several years using homeopathic remedies. The case is used to illustrate the concept of "case remedy mapping", where the patient's symptoms and the prescribed remedies are tracked over time to understand the patient's progress and the effectiveness of the treatment. The lecture covers the boy's initial acute symptoms and the remedies given, such as Belladonna and Stramonium, followed by the boy's constitutional remedy, Calcarea carbonica. As the boy grows older, his symptoms change and new remedies are prescribed, such as Tuberculinum. The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's energy and vital force, and selecting remedies based on the totality of symptoms rather than just the presenting complaint. The lecture also touches on the relationship between different remedies and the concept of miasms in homeopathy.
