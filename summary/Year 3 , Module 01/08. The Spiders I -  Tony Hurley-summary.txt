Here are the answers to the questions based on the lecture transcript:

<summary>
In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses the characteristics and themes of spider remedies in homeopathy. He explains that all spider remedies have a connection to the tarantula picture, with emphasis on survival, aggression, sexuality, and solitude. Spiders tend to be cold, chilly remedies with a strong relationship to vibration, music, rhythm, and noise. Hurley goes into detail on two specific spider remedies: tarantula cubensis, which is similar to the remedy pyrogen made from rotting meat, and is used for septic states and agonizing pain; and Floridian, the orange spider, which is characterized by hypersensitivity to noise that agitates the nervous system, leading to vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of libido. Other key symptoms of Floridian include a sense of duality/split, delusions, craving for oranges and bananas, and complaints related to puberty, pregnancy and menopause.
