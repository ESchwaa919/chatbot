In this lecture, Mike Bridger discusses case and remedy mapping in homeopathy. He emphasizes the importance of prescribing the right remedy at the right time, rather than simply giving a remedy based on the patient's constitution. Bridger explains that remedies are often related and can be seen as a constellation around a case. He also discusses the importance of working gently with the patient's vital force, allowing it to reveal what it needs in its own time. Bridger presents a case of a young boy with tonsillitis and behavioral issues, and walks through the process of prescribing remedies based on the patient's symptoms and the relationships between remedies. He also discusses the use of different potencies and repetitions of remedies based on the patient's vital force and the severity of the disease.
