In this lecture, Mike Bridger discusses case mapping in homeopathy. He starts by reviewing remedy maps and relationships between remedies. He then presents a case of an 8-year-old boy with tonsillitis and discusses the approach to analyzing the case, considering the acute symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and potential miasmatic influences. The lecturer emphasizes the importance of thinking ahead about possible responses to the prescribed remedy and planning accordingly. He guides the audience through the process of symptom selection and remedy differentiation, highlighting the significance of characteristic symptoms and the hierarchy of symptoms. The case analysis reveals Belladonna as the acute remedy, with Calcarea Carbonica as the likely constitutional remedy. In the follow-up, the patient's symptoms change, indicating the need for a different remedy, which is identified as Mercurius based on the new symptom picture. The lecturer explains the relationship between the remedies and the progression of the disease process. Throughout the lecture, he engages with the audience, encouraging active participation and critical thinking.
