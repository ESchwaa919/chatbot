In this lecture, Dion Tabrett provides an introduction to the repertory, a tool used in homeopathy to help practitioners find the correct remedy for a patient's symptoms. He explains that the repertory is an encyclopedia that lists symptoms and the remedies associated with them, and that it is used in conjunction with the materia medica, which provides detailed information about each remedy. Tabrett covers three different ways to use the repertory: totality style, elimination technique, and spot checking. He emphasizes the importance of accurate case-taking and the skill required to translate symptoms into rubrics. Tabrett also discusses the use of computer repertories and the importance of learning the keynotes of each remedy.

1. The repertory as a tool for finding the correct remedy: The repertory is an encyclopedia that lists symptoms and the remedies associated with them. It is used in conjunction with the materia medica to help practitioners find the correct remedy for a patient's symptoms.

2. Different ways to use the repertory: Tabrett covers three different ways to use the repertory: totality style, elimination technique, and spot checking. Totality style involves taking a chronic case and translating six to eight symptoms into rubrics, then adding up how much each remedy scores across the rubrics. Elimination technique involves finding a primary rubric and only considering the remedies in that rubric. Spot checking involves looking up a specific symptom in the repertory to see which remedies are associated with it.

3. The importance of accurate case-taking: Tabrett emphasizes the importance of accurate case-taking in order to find the correct rubric and remedies. He notes that it is crucial to ask the right questions in order to get the information needed to find the correct remedy.

4. Learning the keynotes of each remedy: Tabrett recommends learning the keynotes of each remedy in order to better understand and differentiate between them. He suggests selecting two or three keynotes from each materia medica lecture and looking them up in the repertory to become more familiar with the book.
