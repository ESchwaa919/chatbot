Here are my responses to your questions based on the lecture transcript:

<summary>
The lecture discusses two homeopathic cases: one of a woman suffering from a persistent cough, and another of a woman with chronic asthma. For the first case, the homeopath selects the remedy Bryonia based on key symptoms like violent cough, 9pm aggravation, and desire for coffee. The woman's condition resolves with infrequent dosing of Bryonia 30C.

In the second case, the homeopath chooses Arsenicum album for the irritable, fastidious woman whose asthma is aggravated by various triggers. The woman also has strong general symptoms like aggravation from fruits and striated nails. She is prescribed liquid doses of Arsenicum 30C twice daily, and her asthma resolves completely within a few months. The lecture also discusses Hahnemann's approach of using liquid remedies and succussion.

</topics>

<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway is that Hahnemann found liquid remedies with succussion to be up to 75% more effective than single dry doses, and changed his prescribing approach accordingly in the 6th edition of the Organon.
