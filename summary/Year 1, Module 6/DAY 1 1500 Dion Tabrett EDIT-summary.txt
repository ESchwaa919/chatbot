This lecture covers the topic of Classical Homeopathy, focusing on case taking, repertorization, and prescribing remedies based on patient symptoms. The lecturer walks through two cases: a one-year-old boy with eczema and a 28-year-old woman with a persistent cough. For each case, the lecturer demonstrates how to select relevant symptoms, find corresponding rubrics in the homeopathic repertory, and determine the most appropriate remedy. The lecture emphasizes the importance of considering mental, emotional, and physical symptoms, as well as modalities and generals, in order to find the best-fitting remedy. The lecturer also touches on potency selection and dosing, and provides follow-up information for each case.

1. Classical Homeopathy: The lecture focuses on the principles and practice of Classical Homeopathy, which involves treating patients based on their individual symptoms and selecting a single remedy that best matches the patient's overall symptom picture.

2. Case Taking: The lecturer demonstrates how to take a homeopathic case, gathering information about the patient's presenting complaint, medical history, family history, and general symptoms. The case taking process is crucial for identifying the most relevant symptoms to guide remedy selection.

3. Repertorization: The lecturer explains how to use a homeopathic repertory to find rubrics (symptom categories) that correspond to the patient's symptoms. By cross-referencing the rubrics, the homeopath can identify the remedies that are most strongly indicated for the patient's case.

4. Remedy Selection and Potency: The lecturer discusses how to differentiate between remedies and select the most appropriate one based on the patient's unique symptom picture.
