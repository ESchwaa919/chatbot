In this lecture, Colin Griffith discusses the importance of the midline in the body and how trauma can affect it. He explains that the midline is not just the spine, but an organizing axis that includes fluid energy and a gyroscopic organ of direction. Trauma, such as accidents, birth trauma, vaccination, and anesthesia, can knock the body out of alignment and cause various physical and emotional symptoms. Griffith emphasizes the significance of working with other practitioners, such as osteopaths and acupuncturists, to address these issues. He also shares a case study of a child with birth trauma who was successfully treated with homeopathy and cranial osteopathy.
