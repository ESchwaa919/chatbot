<summary>
The lecture discusses a case of a 6-year-old boy with psoriasis since birth. The lecturer describes the case details, including the boy's symptoms, family medical history, and physical and mental characteristics. He then guides the audience through the process of identifying the appropriate homeopathic remedy for the case using rubrics and repertorization. Initially, the lecturer prescribed Graphites based on the lesion symptoms, but it did not work. Upon further analysis of the boy's general symptoms and desires/aversions, the lecturer identified Phosphorus as the constitutional remedy that matches both the lesion and the general state. The boy was treated with Phosphorus LM potency along with Bacillinum as an intercurrent remedy for the underlying tubercular miasm. The treatment was successful, and the psoriasis resolved within 4-6 months.
