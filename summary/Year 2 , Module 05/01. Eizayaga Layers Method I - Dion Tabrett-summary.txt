The lecture introduces the four layers of the method: constitutional, fundamental, lesional, and miasmatic. It focuses on the constitutional layer, which Eizayaga defines as an individual's healthy base remedy that corresponds to their DNA and physical characteristics. The lecture also explores the historical context of the constitutional approach, discussing the work of French homeopath Antoine Nebel and his categorization of calc-carb constitutions. The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding the healthy state of an individual and treating back to their constitutional remedy.
