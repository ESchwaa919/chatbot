The lecture titled "03. Liver and Biliary System A&P - Sian Moss USE THIS ONE" provides a detailed overview of the anatomy and physiology of the liver and biliary system. The lecture covers the location and structure of the liver, including its lobes, blood supply, and the organization of hepatic lobules. It also discusses the functions of the liver, including carbohydrate metabolism, fat metabolism, bile formation, storage of vitamins and minerals, synthesis of plasma proteins, breakdown of hemoglobin, elimination of amino acids, and detoxification. The lecture emphasizes the importance of the liver in maintaining normal blood glucose levels through the processes of glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and the role of hormones such as insulin and glucagon in regulating these processes. Additionally, the lecture covers the formation and storage of bile in the gallbladder, and its role in fat digestion. The lecture also touches on the importance of vitamin B12 and iron storage in the liver, and the detoxification pathways in the liver.
