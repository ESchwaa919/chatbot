<summary>
In this lecture, Dion Tabrett discusses the Eizayaga Layers Method of homeopathic prescribing. He explains the concept of a constitutional remedy, which is the healthy base state remedy for an individual. He then introduces the idea of a fundamental layer, which is a remedy state that can graft on top of the constitutional state due to a traumatic event or etiology. Tabrett provides case examples to illustrate how a person can shift from their constitutional state into a fundamental state, and how this can manifest in changes in their physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. He also discusses how a person can go deeper into their constitutional state, and how maintaining causes can prevent healing of layers. Tabrett compares the Eizayaga approach to Kentian and Hahnemannian approaches, and discusses the controversies and politics surrounding these different methods.

1. Constitutional remedy: The constitutional remedy is the healthy base state remedy for an individual. It is based on their morphology, physique, and symptoms. (2-3 sentences)
2. Fundamental layer: The fundamental layer is a remedy state that can graft on top of the constitutional state due to a traumatic event or etiology. It can manifest in changes in physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. (2-3 sentences)
3. Case examples: Tabrett provides case examples to illustrate how a person can shift from their constitutional state into a fundamental state, and how this can manifest in changes in their symptoms. (2-3 sentences)
4. Maintaining causes: Maintaining causes are factors that can prevent healing of layers. Tabrett discusses how removing maintaining causes is key to successful treatment. (2-3 sentences)
5. Comparisons to other approaches: Tabrett compares the Eizayaga approach to Kentian and Hahnemannian approaches, and discusses the controversies and politics surrounding these different methods. (2-3 sentences)
