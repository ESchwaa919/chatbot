In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses the tissue salts, a group of homeopathic remedies. He goes through each remedy alphabetically, starting with Kali mur (Potassium chloride), which is used for thick, white catarrhal discharges. Kali phos (Potassium phosphate) is the main remedy for nervous exhaustion and brain fog. Kali sulph (Potassium sulfate) is used for yellow discharges and has overlaps with the remedy Pulsatilla. Mag phos (Magnesium phosphate) is the main remedy for cramps, including menstrual cramps. Natrum mur (Sodium chloride) is a deep-acting remedy for watery discharges and grief. Natrum phos (Sodium phosphate) is used for acid conditions and to balance pH. Natrum sulph (Sodium sulfate) is used to eliminate fluids and treats depression, especially after head injuries. Finally, Silica is used for weakness, lack of grit, spinal problems, and recurrent infections in children.
