In this lecture, Robert Bridge presents a case of a 48-year-old woman who came to see him as a student homeopath. The woman had a history of relapsing scrub typhus fever, which she contracted while working as a journalist for the United Nations in Cambodia. She also had a history of toxoplasmosis, paratyphoid, scorpion bite, mild stroke, kidney infection, and a blood transfusion as a rhesus baby. The woman was seeking treatment for the relapsing fever, which followed a cycle of eight weeks and lasted for five days. Bridge discusses the symptoms of the fever, including feeling drugged, white face with red streaks, swollen veins in the neck, feeling of blood clotting, enlarged lymph nodes on the left side, and hemorrhaging under the skin. He also discusses the woman's mental and emotional state, including her determination to get justice from the United Nations and her gung-ho attitude. Bridge then guides the students through the process of analyzing the case and finding appropriate rubrics in the repertory. He ultimately prescribes Lachesis in a split dose of 30c and 200c, which leads to the resolution of the woman's symptoms.
