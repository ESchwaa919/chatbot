<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is Griffith's statement that homeopathy today needs Thuja and that if homeopathy were a person, he would prescribe Thuja to it every day for a week. This is because, according to Griffith, homeopaths are often peddling half-truths and trying to write the manual of homeopathy in stone, rather than focusing on individualized treatment.
