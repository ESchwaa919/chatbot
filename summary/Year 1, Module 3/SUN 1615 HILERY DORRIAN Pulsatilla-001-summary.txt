<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the effectiveness of Pulsatilla in turning breech babies. The lecturer shares a story about her friend Deb, who was told at 36-37 weeks pregnant that her baby was in a breech position and that she should prepare for a C-section. However, within 30 minutes of taking Pulsatilla, Deb felt the baby turn dramatically, and a subsequent midwife examination confirmed that the baby was no longer breech. The lecturer suggests that Pulsatilla works so well for turning breech babies because it addresses the baby's Pulsatilla state, rather than the mother's.
