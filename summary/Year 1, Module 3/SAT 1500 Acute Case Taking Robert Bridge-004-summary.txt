In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses a case of acute prescribing in homeopathy. He was approached by the daughter of a woman who was in intensive care with a septic infection related to a gallstone condition. The woman had a stent placed in her common bile duct, which had become infected, leading to septicemia, kidney failure, and respiratory failure. She was on life support and given a poor prognosis by the medical team. Despite his initial reluctance, Robert agreed to take on the case and visited the woman in the hospital. Based on his observations and the available information, he prescribed the homeopathic remedy Lachesis, which was administered to the woman's wrist. Over the next few days, the woman's condition improved dramatically, surprising both Robert and the medical staff. She was eventually taken off life support and antibiotics, and her kidney function recovered. Robert later prescribed Arnica to address the woman's shock and support her recovery. The case left a lasting impact on Robert, reinforcing his belief in the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in acute situations.
