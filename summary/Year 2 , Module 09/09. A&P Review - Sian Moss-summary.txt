<summary>
In this lecture, Sian Moss reviews key anatomy, physiology, and pathology concepts related to the liver, digestive system, female reproductive system, and male reproductive system. The lecture covers the main functions of the liver, hormones involved in glucose metabolism, bile production and storage, and common liver pathologies such as hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The digestive system pathologies discussed include inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. The female reproductive system review includes the four main hormones involved in the menstrual cycle, their functions, and the pathophysiology of endometriosis. The male reproductive system topics cover the functions of the prostate gland, testicular torsion, and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.

1. Liver anatomy, physiology, and pathology: The lecture covers the main functions of the liver, such as detoxification, fat metabolism, bile production, and glucose regulation. It also discusses common liver pathologies like hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

2. Digestive system pathologies: The lecture focuses on inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.

3. Female reproductive system: The lecture reviews the four main hormones involved in the menstrual cycle (estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone), their functions, and the pathophysiology of endometriosis.

4. Male reproductive system: The lecture covers the functions of the prostate gland, the importance of recognizing testicular torsion, and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.
