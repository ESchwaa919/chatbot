In this lecture, Hilery Dorrian demonstrates how to take a live case in a homeopathy class. She interviews a student volunteer about her lower back pain that started after a long car journey and has been ongoing for a month. Hilery asks about the patient's pain, medical history, family health history, childhood, relationships, and personality. The patient shares details about her difficult relationships, single parenthood, and challenges with her son who has autism. Hilery then opens up the discussion to the class to analyze the case and suggest possible remedies. The class suggests remedies such as Natrum muriaticum, Calcarea phosphorica, Anacardium, and Staphysagria. Hilery agrees that Anacardium could be a good fit based on the patient's history of humiliation, fear of exams, and sensitivity to suffering. She also suggests Aesculus and Proteus as other possibilities for the patient's back pain.
