In this lecture, Colin Griffith discusses the importance of understanding the effects of old injuries on the body. He uses volunteers from the audience to demonstrate how the body can be asymmetrical due to past injuries or trauma. He emphasizes the significance of the coccyx and how injuries to it can lead to a lack of grounding and centeredness. Griffith also explains the concept of the reciprocal tension membrane, which surrounds every joint and is connected to ligaments and tendons, acting as a "black box" that records everything that happens to the body. He highlights the interconnectedness of the body's diaphragms and how tension in one area can cause problems in others, such as digestive issues, asthma, or jaw problems. Griffith stresses the importance of addressing unresolved accidents or injuries in patients and recommends the use of specific homeopathic remedies and cranial osteopathy to facilitate healing.
