In this lecture, Tony Hurley discusses two homeopathic remedies: Ruta graveolens (Ruta) and Eupatorium perfoliatum. Ruta is useful for treating eyestrain, repetitive strain injuries, ligament and tendon issues, bone bruises, and prolapsed organs. It is also indicated for apathy, dissatisfaction, and a tendency towards paranoia. Eupatorium perfoliatum, also known as "bone set," is primarily used for severe bone pains associated with certain types of flu, as well as tropical illnesses like dengue fever and chikungunya. The lecturer shares a personal experience of successfully using Eupatorium for a flu with severe body aches and a peculiar craving for ice cream.
