<summary>
The lecture titled "7. Cell physiology - Sian Moss" covers several key topics related to cell biology. The lecture begins with an overview of cellular transport mechanisms, including endocytosis, exocytosis, pinocytosis, and phagocytosis. The lecturer then discusses passive transport processes such as diffusion and osmosis, explaining the concepts of hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic solutions. Active transport is also covered, with an emphasis on the role of ATP and membrane proteins in moving substances against their concentration gradients. The lecture then moves on to cell division, discussing the differences between mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is described as a process for growth and repair, resulting in genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis is a process for gamete formation, resulting in genetic variation. The lecturer uses engaging analogies and examples to illustrate these concepts, such as the tube train analogy for active transport and the rhiwbina example for diffusion. The lecture concludes with a brief overview of body cavities and their contents.

<topics>
1. Cellular transport mechanisms: The lecture covers various cellular transport mechanisms, including endocytosis, exocytosis, pinocytosis, and phagocytosis. These processes are important for the movement of substances into and out of cells, as well as within cells.

2. Passive transport: The lecture discusses passive transport processes such as diffusion and osmosis. These processes are driven by concentration gradients and do not require energy input from the cell.

3. Active transport: The lecture covers active transport, which involves the movement of substances against their concentration gradients using energy from ATP. This process is mediated by membrane proteins and is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

4. Cell division: The lecture discusses cell division, focusing on the differences between mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is described as a process for growth and repair, while meiosis is a process for gamete formation and genetic variation.

5. Body cavities: The lecture concludes with a brief overview of body cavities, including the cranial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities, and their contents.
