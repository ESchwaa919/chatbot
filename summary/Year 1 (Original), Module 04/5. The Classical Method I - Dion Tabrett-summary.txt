In this lecture, Dion Tabrett discusses the classical method of homeopathy. He guides the audience through two case studies, illustrating how to use the repertory to find the appropriate remedy for each case. The first case involves a 5-year-old boy with tonsillitis, and the second case is a 26-year-old female presenting with cystitis. Tabrett explains how to select symptoms from the case and turn them into rubrics, using the repertory to find the most suitable remedy. He also discusses potency selection, explaining that lower potencies are more suitable for physical symptoms and higher potencies for psychological cases. The lecture emphasizes the importance of using the repertory and Materia Medica together to find the best remedy for each individual case.
