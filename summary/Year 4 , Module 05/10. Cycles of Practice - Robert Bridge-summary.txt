In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses the different stages that practitioners go through in their practice, based on a scheme that was shared with him when he was a student. He describes five stages: the student stage, where practitioners are enthusiastic and optimistic; the self-doubt stage, where practitioners blame themselves for not being good enough; the blaming others stage, where practitioners blame their patients or external factors; the blaming homeopathy stage, where practitioners lose faith in the therapy itself; and finally, the stage of acceptance and authenticity, where practitioners let go of their ego and focus on creating a space for their patients to heal. Throughout the lecture, Bridge shares personal anecdotes and case studies to illustrate each stage, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and self-reflection in the journey of becoming a practitioner.
