In this lecture, Robert Bridge discusses two complex cases from his homeopathic practice. The first case involves a two-year-old girl with a swollen abdomen and pale stools, whose mother sought homeopathic treatment. Despite initial misdiagnosis and inadequate follow-up, the child was eventually found to have primary liver cancer and passed away. The second case revolves around a woman with a reported skin rash and a history of abuse, who became increasingly demanding and manipulative during treatment. The lecturer shares his insights on the importance of recognizing one's limitations, maintaining boundaries, and referring patients when necessary.
