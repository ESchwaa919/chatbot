He explains the general symptoms, mental and emotional symptoms, and keynotes of each remedy. Ferrum magneticum is described as a remedy for those overwhelmed by the technological age, with symptoms of mental exhaustion, confusion, and addiction to media. Tormentil is presented as a remedy for surrender, calmness, and detachment during times of stress and upheaval. Prunella vulgaris, also known as "self-heal", is portrayed as a restorative remedy that heals past wounds and traumas, particularly those affecting the throat and mucous membranes.
