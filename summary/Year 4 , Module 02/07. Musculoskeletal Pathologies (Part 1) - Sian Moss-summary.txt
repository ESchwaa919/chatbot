<takeaway>
The most surprising takeaway from this lecture is the potential role of mental and emotional stress in the development of musculoskeletal pathologies, such as scoliosis. The lecturer mentions a case of a young teenager who developed severe scoliosis at a rapid pace, which the doctors attributed to the stress the family was going through at the time.
