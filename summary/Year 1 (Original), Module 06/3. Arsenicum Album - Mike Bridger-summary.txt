Here are my responses to the questions based on the lecture transcript:

<summary>
In this lecture, Mike Bridger provides a detailed overview of the homeopathic remedy Arsenicum Album. He describes the typical Arsenicum patient as highly anxious, restless, chilly, and fearful of losing control. They are perfectionists who want everything tidy and in order. Arsenicum is indicated for conditions that come on suddenly with burning pains, such as food poisoning, asthma, colds, and even cancer. The remedy is useful for treating anxiety and restlessness in dying patients. Bridger emphasizes the importance of observing the patient's symptoms and selecting the remedy based on the totality of symptoms. He also cautions against using Arsenicum as a deep-acting, constitutional remedy in chronic cases.
