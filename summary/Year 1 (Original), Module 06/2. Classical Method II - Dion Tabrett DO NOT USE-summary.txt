Here are the answers to the questions based on the lecture transcript:

<summary>
The lecture covers two classical homeopathic cases in detail. The first case is a 33-year-old female with dry eye and constipation for 2.5 years, who takes Aqua lube at night. Repertorization leads to the remedies zinc and alumina, with alumina being prescribed in 200C potency weekly for 4 weeks with good results. The second case is a 40-year-old male architect with migraine headaches aggravated by stress and deadlines at work, and ameliorated on vacation. He has fears of water, disease, and heart disease. The lecturer assigns homework to look up rubrics for migraine, head pain left temple, head pain left eye, and aggravation from tobacco.
